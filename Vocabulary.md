**Do you have many close friends?**

No, I don't have many close friends. I prefer to keep my circle small and focus on building deeper, more meaningful relationships with a few people rather than having a large number of acquaintances. I find that having a few close friends allows me to give and receive more support, trust, and understanding

**Which do you prefer to spend time with: a friend or spend time alone?**

I prefer to spend time alone. Being alone allows me to relax, and do activities I enjoy without any distractions. It helps me recharge. While spending time with friends is fun, I value the peace and quiet that comes with being by myself.

I don't have any specifics but I think with people I feel compatible and happy

**Do you like face-to-face conversations with people?**

We often play games together. Because we live far away, whenever we get together, we will organize a meal.

Yes, I think it's possible to become real friends with people you meet on the internet. Online interactions can lead to meaningful connections if you take the time to get to know each other and share common interests. Many friendships start online and grow into strong, real-life relationships. However, it's important to be cautious and ensure that the person is genuine before meeting in person.
