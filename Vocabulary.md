 **Do you like learning languages?**
	yes, i think it is a great way to connect with different cultures and understand the world better. For example, with English, it helps me a lot in my work such as communicating with customers and reading documents
**Do you think it is difficult to learn a new language?**
yes. it often require much time to learn vocabulary, grammar rules, and pronunciation  But I think, for people who work hard and practice regularly, it won't be too difficult
**How do you learn the new languages?**
First I will learn pronunciation, after practicing pronunciation I will practice listening along with writing and finally speaking.
**Why do people learn more than one language?**
I think people want to travel and talk to people in other countries and they need it for their job or to get a better job. Learning a new language can also help you understand different cultures and make new friends.
