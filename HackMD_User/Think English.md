### Tips


what is it, and talked about the things that were going to be doing in this course.

Remember, an English brain, simply what I call an English brain is just your ability to think in English.

And I want to in this lesson, just talk about a few things that you should remember and a few basic

tips for this course and after this course for all of your English studies.

OK, a few things, too, we could say.

Keep in mind a few things to keep in mind.

So let's go over a few things, the first thing to remember is that you're going to have to work hard

if you want to be fluent, if you want to be a great English speaker, you've got to work hard.

You may be asking for or wanting a very fast little trick to become an awesome English speaker.

Well, this depends on the students.

Some students can improve really quickly.

But generally, I can tell you, if you want to be good at something, you have to practice it.

This is obvious.

I hope you don't think that at the end of this course you're going to magically be a fluent English

speaker.

Of course not.

Probably.

OK, now I hope you can take the things from this course and then practice the ideas from it again and

again until you do become a fluent English speaker.

That's the idea.

So I just hope that you keep in your mind that practice is the thing that gets you to fluency, not

just learning.

Right.

Learning is the first step.

I see.

That's how I should do it.

Now I'm going to take that idea and do it many, many, many times.

So learning something is often not enough.

You have to learn it and apply it, do it, practice it many times.

Practice will get you to where you're going, but you have to practice in the right way.

Now, some students say, well, yeah, I know I should maybe learn to think in English when I'm speaking,

but that's not the only way I can also do it.

Another way I can learn by or through my own language right now, think in my language and then speak

in English, and then I will become fluent.

Both ways are OK.

No, you will not meet and you cannot meet.

A person who thinks in their language and at the same time speaks in another, it doesn't happen if

there's a perfect speaker of this language or maybe they learned that language when they're speaking

that language perfectly, they're thinking in that language.

And if they change and speak in another language, maybe their own language, then they're thinking

in that language, the only way, the only way.

There's only one road.

There aren't two roads.

Both are not OK.

The only way is to learn to think in English.

If you do not do it, you will not be a fluent English speaker.

It's that simple.

If you do not do it, if you do not learn to think in English, you will not be a fluent English speaker.

I can promise you.

I've asked a lot of successful students, I've talked to a lot of successful language learners, I've

had a lot of experience teaching students and the ones who succeed, the ones who do it well are the

ones who change their way of thinking and start thinking in English.

It's the only way.

So.

Both ways are not OK.

Another really important thing to remember is that time does not equal success.

You can spend a lot of time doing the wrong thing, doing things the wrong way.

And one of the perfect examples of this is the way to study words.

Now, we'll be talking about that very soon.

In another lesson.

We'll be talking about that the time that you put in, plus the methods that you use together.

These things can make you successful.

This is a way to improve English effectively.

You can spend a lot of time learning words an incorrect way and not see much progress.

I've met students in the past who studied for years, two years, studying every day, almost nothing,

almost no progress.

It happens.

So time is not the only thing.

It's also about the way you do it.

Time is important.

You need time, but it's not the only thing.

Now you see three words here.

Play, jump, swim.

Why did I put these three words here?

All right.

Well, it's simple.

Don't think of English as this very, very hard thing like science where this is this right.

If you do this, you will get this.

And this is the only way this can be done.

Think of it like this, because if you do that, you won't really challenge yourself to think creatively

in English.

So you have to be able to think creatively.

In English to be able to to do well, to be able to improve, so play with the language, play with

it, have fun with it, see if this and this works together.

Right.

If you learn two things or you learn something new, try to see if you can make it work in this way

and then maybe ask, is this right?

Ask someone who knows, is this the right way?

Don't only follow what someone teaches.

You write someone teaches you.

This is right.

Well, that might be right, but something else might also be right.

So when you learn something, play with it.

And by playing with it, you explore more about that thing you learn.

This is a really great way to understand more about the language, how it works and what you can do

with it.

Also, I have the words jump here.

Jump means not to have any reservations.

That means don't be shy, don't be shy, if you have the opportunity to speak in English, speak, try.

You might think, oh, I'm not I'm not good enough.

Right.

I don't know exactly how to say it.

I don't know the right words to use.

Just try.

The ones who improve more quickly are the ones who just try.

OK, maybe you don't know the right word.

Is there another way to say it?

Can you describe it instead of saying the word?

So jump into it, be more enthusiastic, be energetic, use every opportunity or chance that you have

to use and practice English.

And by doing this, you will be around English more and you will find out where your problems are.

Oh, I tried this.

It didn't work.

They didn't understand that.

So next time, maybe I'll try this way.

Oh, that worked.

OK, I got it.

But if you never tried if you just sat back and say, well, I'm not good enough, I don't know the

right words, you'll never know this wasn't right.

You'll never know.

This was weird, right?

Being wrong, sometimes sounding strange, sometimes sounding incorrect or being incorrect.

Sometimes that's ok.

That is OK.

By making mistakes, by jumping in and making mistakes, you will actually improve.

So don't be afraid.

Don't be shy.

Just try.

Don't be afraid.

Don't be shy.

Just try.

It runs good swim swimming.

Basically what I mean is immerse yourself.

Immerse yourself means to surround yourself with the language if you want to learn a language, how

can you learn it just by looking at little pieces of the language, say English from your own language.

If you learn English through your language only.

And you learn the meaning of that word with your language rather than that language.

Yeah, yeah, maybe OK, you might learn something, but it won't be very deep and you won't be able

to really, really get a feeling for it.

Right.

And it also might be a little bit slow.

And it certainly won't help you to think in English, which is what this course is about.

So.

Immerse yourself.

Be around English as much as you can.

The best way to do this is to go to an English speaking country and live there.

But not everybody can do that, right.

So there are many ways to surround yourself with English.

And I'm sure you know some of those movies, TV, radio, reading, write articles, literature, poetry,

listening to to a lot of different things.

All of these are ways to immerse yourself to swim in English.

OK, don't be afraid to surround yourself with the language you're trying to learn.

That's called immersion.

And if you do it, you're more likely to improve more quickly and you're more likely to be able to think

in English and you're more likely to be able to get a feeling for English.

OK, so.

Play, jump, swim.

I have a 30 minute rule for anything you want to learn.

You can't just do it sometimes and not others.

You need to do it regularly.

Right.

Just like if you want to be strong, you want to build muscle.

You won't be able to build muscle if you go to the gym once every two weeks, you'll maybe build a little

muscle and then lose the muscle and then you go back to the gym.

Two weeks later, you build a little muscle, you won't see much improvement.

What's the same for English?

So you need to make clear rules for yourself.

I mentioned that you need to spend time, but I want to be a little more specific now.

Every day you have to practice English.

You have to keep English in your mind every day.

And I have a limit about how much that should be at least 30 minutes.

So you have to spend at least 30 minutes, seven days a week for as long as it takes to become really

good at English.

OK, it's not asking a lot.

24 hours in a day, 30 minutes is not that much.

I think spending more than 30 minutes is better, of course, but no less than 30 minutes at least.

Challenge yourself 30 minutes a day.

Make time.

If you're serious about it, you will.

OK, so 30 minutes a day and get into the habit of practicing or doing something with English 30 minutes

a day and you will see results.

If you want to be good at something, it's often difficult to see what your own problems are.

So you need some kind of feedback.

Now, this is really the reason that teachers exist.

Right, teachers exist mainly to give you feedback about what you do to help you improve, whether you

hit the gym with your personal trainer or whether you're in a class with a teacher.

So the teacher is there to guide you.

This is one way to do it.

You need some kind of feedback.

So taking a class is good.

OK, as long as you can get feedback so you can know what you're doing right, what you're doing wrong,

which direction you should be going if you can't get a teacher.

There are other ways to get some feedback.

You might find a forum.

Or a place where you can ask questions and get answers to your questions.

OK, now there are many different places where you can do this, but this is another idea.

There are other ways maybe your friends are also learning English and you can use them as a way to get

some feedback about what you might be doing right.

What you might be doing wrong could form a group and practice together and give each other feedback.

This is a good way as well.

It's not bad.

So in any case, it's important to have some kind of feedback, some way to find out how you're doing.

Right, because you might be doing something really, really wrong and then you make that wrong thing

a bad habit, and then it would be really difficult to change that bad habit.

So some kind of feedback is pretty important.

Some way to ask questions, at least.

At least now the first of these is OK, most people can handle that idea.

The second is a little more difficult for some.

The first is to make English a part of your lifestyle.

I had mentioned that you should spend 30 minutes a day at least doing something with English, doing

some of the things that we'll be talking about in the rest of this course.

So make it a habit that's making it part of your lifestyle.

Right.

But another aspect of that lifestyle thing is that you don't really think about right now.

It's time for me to study English.

Now it's time for me to spend 30 minutes, which I hate practicing English.

So this isn't the best way of doing it.

This I wouldn't consider really a lifestyle lifestyle.

English means you just do it and it's part of your routine and you don't hate it.

It's just something that's there.

And actually it's better if you can enjoy it.

So the next part is to try to enjoy the process of learning English and trying to become more fluent.

The students who are most successful usually are the ones who really, really enjoy learning English,

actually like learning English.

If you like doing something, you're much more likely to be successful at it.

If you hate doing something, it is less likely that you will be good at doing that.

So try to find something about the language that you enjoy.

You can still improve.

You can still get better if you don't really like it.

But it's certainly ideal if you can find something about it that you really like, that is the best

situation.

So try to enjoy it, make it part of your lifestyle.

And that's that's really important.

So in the next lesson, we're going to be talking about how we can learn and practice by reading the

importance of reading and how we can read in the right way to develop our English brain.

So I will see you in the next lesson.

### Reading
So in the last video, we talked about some general ideas, things to remember, to help you, to learn

how to think in English, very general things.

So in this lesson, we're going to really, really start actually doing some real practice, some real

work toward being able to easily think in English.

So we're going to be talking about reading today and the importance of reading.

By the way, reading is really important.

OK, you may be thinking reading boring.

I don't need to learn to read.

I want to be a good speaker.

You might be thinking that or you might think, well, reading, of course reading.

But but I already know how to read.

I know what reading is.

Why are you talking about it, Luke?

I'm Luke.

Well, I'm talking about it because I want to show you how to read.

And for those of you who think reading is not important, in fact, it is important.

Let me give you a simple example, OK?

Nobody would say.

I want to have the fruit and the leaves of the tree, but I don't want there to be any tree.

OK, the leaves.

Let's use the leaves as an example, leaf, right, make a leaf here.

No, not that great, but that's a leaf.

OK, I want to have the leaf of the tree, but no tree, please.

Well, this is a similar idea.

I want to be a great English speaker.

I want to be able to think perfectly in English and express myself about everything.

But I don't want to understand English doesn't work like that.

OK, reading is like the tree in some ways.

It's not the only thing like that, but really reading literature.

Newspapers, magazines, books, novels, write, all of this gives you a foundation.

Foundation is something strong that holds everything up, a foundation, a deep understanding of English,

98 percent of native English speakers, perhaps more, maybe 99 percent of native English speakers like

myself had a very deep or have, I should say, have a very deep background in in literature and reading

the primary school, middle school, high school and continuing into adulthood.

Now, I often read reading gives you a deeper understanding of the language, and there are many different

forms of literature, right?

There are many different styles of writing.

All of this helps you figure out how you can best express yourself.

What is the reason that someone who learns every English idiom, expression and maybe 30000 English

words still can't speak like a native speaker?

Well, there are a number of different reasons.

One reason I haven't read very much literature, I don't have a deep understanding of the language.

This is one reason.

So think of reading as the trunk, the main part of the tree.

OK, and then you can get the leaves more easily.

Reading is really important.

So now we're going to talk about how to read what is the best way to read, and then we'll talk about

some different resources, some things you can read.

So let's continue.

OK, so we're now going to look at a short actually single sentence.

And I just want to give you a feeling about what reading can do for you and how you should do it when

you're actually when you're actually reading if you want to get the most benefit from that.

OK, so let's look at this sentence.

And I've just written this.

This might be something from an article.

Maybe you're reading an article about French wine or an article about red wine, maybe you're reading

something online, OK, and you read the following sentence.

While red wine is produced in many different regions around the world, each of these regions share

common features.

OK, now for some of you, I'm sure you understand this completely.

For others of you, perhaps not.

OK, so I'll talk about the meaning and how to look at it.

But first, if you do understand this 100 percent, that doesn't mean this is useless to you, still

useful to you.

Now, you've seen a common way that a person who understands how to speak and write probably pretty

well.

Right.

Naturally expresses themselves about a certain idea.

So you've seen how it's done this kind of thing.

Just reading like this can give you a basic foundation, a general feeling.

General feeling.

That's an I.

Whoo hoo hoo.

That's an eye, a general feeling for the language.

This is one very good way to express this particular idea.

Not the only way, but it is one way.

I and so the more you read, the more you get a feeling about these things.

Now, let's actually look at this and see if we can figure out how we can learn more from it.

OK, now let's say, for example, we know the word produced to produce something means to to make something

right.

But maybe we don't know in what situations produced is used.

When do we use produce?

When do we not use produce.

Right.

We can't use produce in every situation.

All right.

We wouldn't say, oh, that woman produced a baby.

I guess you could say that.

But most people don't say a woman produces a baby.

Technically, she does, but we don't say that.

Why not?

I don't know.

I don't know why not.

But I know that that's weird.

OK, and you can get a feeling for what's weird and what isn't weird.

Weird means strange.

By reading, so this is great, we can see here that red wine can be produced or made hurray.

So we know another situation in which this word can be used.

Good, good.

Now, we might see produced in another place about a factory, a factory producing bicycles.

OK, we can use produce there.

We might see something about a movie.

This guy is producing a movie.

Oh, great.

I understand that.

But now that might have another meaning.

Produce means to provide money for and arrange the movie.

OK, so I can get a feeling about that.

So the more you see words like produce in these different situations here, in the situation of talking

about red wine in an article, the more you can get a feeling for this word and the more you get a feeling

for it, the stronger that tree will be.

Right.

The depth of your understanding of English will be.

And you'll be able to use this in the right places and and think with this word rather than just using

it where you guess it should be used, but you're not sure.

Right.

So this is one aspect.

OK, let's continue here.

Red wine, red wine is produced in many different regions around the world here, regions, regions,

let's say, for example, we don't know the word region.

Let's say just for example, you don't know region.

What does region mean?

I don't know.

Well, let's just look at the sentence here and see if we can have a guess, see if we can figure it

out.

OK, well, red wine is produced in many different regions around the world.

Hmm.

Around the world.

OK, in.

Hmm.

Interesting and many different.

Could be also quite important in I think is a key word here and around the world I think is a really,

really important phrase here.

OK, from these two things in can't be that many things.

It could be in the factory maybe.

OK, maybe around the world.

OK, that can't be factory.

That can't be winery.

That can't be the place where it's made the company where it's made.

So it must be something else around the world.

World is a big place.

OK, so in that, that the around the world.

So what could regions be.

You might be able to figure it out or at least get the feeling for what this word might mean, even

though perhaps you don't know the word.

And this is just an example.

Maybe you know this word, but sometimes you will find a word you don't know when you're reading.

The first thing you should do is try to figure it out.

OK, so I'm going to guess that regions because I'm talking about around the world and in I'm going

to guess that this is similar to the word areas.

I know the word areas, I know the word places, many different places around the world, networks,

many different areas around the world that works.

OK, I'm going to guess this is the meaning.

Now, once I have guessed it, maybe I will go and look it up.

Or check it in the dictionary now, you should probably be using all English dictionaries, I recommend

using an only English dictionary.

There's a good website you can use vocabulary.

Dotcom.

To see Dotcom's pretty good, you can look it up there and get a feeling for the word even more, so

that's a good one.

But the first thing we did is we looked at the context.

We looked at the context of the word, the context means how it's used, the sentence around it, the

grammar around it, this is the context of the sentence.

And by checking out the context and trying to figure it out, we are thinking in English, we are forcing

ourselves to think in English.

And this is a really, really important point here.

OK, so this is one of the reasons that reading is really powerful.

Force yourself to think in English.

You gain the ability to guess and figure out words when you're reading.

And so you increase these abilities over time and you learn more words while reading and not only learning

more words now because you're reading it, you see it in the situation.

And so, you know, when this kind of word should be used and when maybe it shouldn't be used.

I've seen the word produced here.

I know it can be used to talk about wine, OK?

I know that now I see regions here, regions of the world.

I know now that that can be about big places, big areas, regions of the world.

That must be a pretty big area, a pretty big place.

OK, so we can begin to get a feeling for the right situation.

And then when we're speaking, we can start using those words correctly in the right situations so that

other people don't feel move.

Why don't you use that word in this situation?

OK, so these things together, all of these things together, the ability to learn new words in context,

the ability to figure things out, thinking in English, the ability to understand why words are used

in the places where they are used, awesome, awesome tools can really deepen your ability to learn

English and definitely can expand your knowledge of English.

OK, let's just go on really quickly and look at the rest of this sentence.

Each of these regions, we have regions again, share common features, share common features.

So let me just tell you what common features means.

Common could mean several things, but one is the same.

Between.

Two or more things.

Maybe you can guess that from the context, the same between two or more things, we have something

in common.

We both like animations, so we have something in common.

A common features what our features.

Well, we could look up the word.

Maybe we can guess it from the from the context.

Right.

We have different regions here, but we know because we have while here that this is going to be a sort

of but similar to a but clause.

Right.

We're going to use part of this sentence to explain that something is different than the first part

of the sentence.

Each of these regions share common features.

So maybe we can guess that features means characteristics or things about those places, things about

those places.

And if we go and check it in a dictionary, we will find that that is true.

OK, so first look at context.

Try to figure it out.

I think make things start going on here in English, then go look it up.

And when you do, I really suggest that you use an only English dictionary.

This is the way to read.

This is how you should be reading.

How about resources?

What should we be reading?

Well, let me just give you a couple of quick suggestions.

If you're looking for general materials to read, I would recommend a couple of different websites.

Interesting stuff here.

And you can learn a lot.

So read it.

Dotcom is a as a website.

That's a community website.

And they have tons of different topics that you can read.

These are called Sub Reddick's subsets.

And there is one about news.

There's one called Reddit.

Funny, there are many different categories or topics that you can read different articles in, and

it's really interesting and there's always new stuff coming out.

So I would recommend this one as a way to get the feeling for for English and to practice your reading

every day.

Wikipedia dot com is a little bit more serious.

Wikipedia is basically an encyclopedia.

It has articles.

About everything, basically almost everything in the world, there is a Wikipedia article about so

you can search things that interest you.

I usually search things about space or dinosaurs and you can read articles about those things.

And I find myself reading articles for two or three hours at a time.

I can't stop myself.

It's so interesting.

So rediff.com, Wikipedia, dot com, these are great Internet resources for reading endlessly.

There's always something to read on these two sites to check those out.

Some people, on the other hand, don't really like reading articles.

They feel I want something that continues from the beginning to the end.

The real story, something I can follow and stay interested in for a long time, something that will

always make me want to keep going.

I understand that.

I understand.

So how about this for fiction?

If you really like fiction, depending on what you're interested in, find a short, simple novel.

I can recommend one that I like.

That's fairly easy.

Harry Potter.

Great series of novels, they're not too difficult, the language used in Harry Potter, not too tough,

but there's still enough there that you can definitely learn a lot.

And the stories are fantastic.

They're interesting.

So if you like fiction, that means a story that's not a true story, then check out Harry Potter.

Or if you're not really interested in magic and this kind of thing fantasy, then there are a lot of

other really good novels out there.

And I'm sure you can you can find something that you like for nonfiction.

I might recommend who is and who was.

So, for example, who was who was Steve Jobs?

Question mark, this is a series where they have many different famous people in the series and you

can read about their lives and the language that they use is not too difficult.

Pretty simple.

And this is nonfiction.

It's about true real people.

OK, so who was Steve Jobs?

Who is Bill Gates?

Many, many different people.

You can read about them there, their short biographies.

Biography is a story about someone.

So these are interesting and useful for those of you who don't really like fiction, things that are

made up.

And I also understand that I often don't like to read fiction either.

So these are a good resource for you.

If you want to read something longer than read it or Wikipedia that's continuous but don't really like

fiction, I would recommend you.

Who is that adult who was DataDot books pretty good.

All right.

So in the next lesson, we're going to be talking about how to learn new words.

We did this a little bit before when we were talking about how to read, write, looking at words in

context.

But we're going to be in the next lesson, really focusing on the best way, the right way to learn

new words.

So I will see you in the next lesson.

### New Word

So let's just begin.

OK, so just a couple of things at first.

One I mentioned in the last lesson, if you're going to learn words, I strongly suggest and it's really

the best thing you can do to learn words in an all English dictionary dictionary.

Is what you use to find the meaning of a word, find the definition.

Of a word, OK, all English dictionaries show you the meaning of the word in English as well, they

explain the meaning of the word to you.

And now why should we look up the meaning of a word in English rather than our own language as long

as I understand the meaning?

Isn't that all that matters?

Well, think about this for a second.

If you learn an English word, I know the word.

OK, Pikul, OK.

But the understanding of the word is back in my old language, my language that I speak naturally,

not English, then every time that word comes up, you first have to think of your language and then

you have to speak the word or you have to understand the word if someone else says it.

Do you think that's fast?

Is that thinking in English?

No, not really.

So the first thing is it can slow you down doing it that way.

The second is it's hard to really understand that word is in one language.

There might be a slightly different meaning to that word.

Maybe the dictionary in your language didn't quite get it or didn't get all of the different meanings.

That's one of the biggest problems, is that many dictionaries between languages aren't perfect and

they don't show you the feeling of the word how the word is used.

OK, so better if you can use an all English dictionary much, much better, because when you're doing

that, you're learning the meet the meaning in English and you're thinking about the word in English

so that when you hear it, you understand the meaning very quickly because the understanding is in the

same language that you heard it in.

When you need to use it and you need to speak it when you need to say it, that comes out in English.

You never need to go over to your other language, your native language.

You don't need to.

Why should you write?

What's the reason?

Is there any benefit from that?

No, no, there's no benefit.

So really important.

Learn words in one language, a language you're trying to learn.

OK, so some people say, well, the dictionary definition in the Oxford English Dictionary, I can't

understand it.

It's too hard.

I have to look up all the words that it uses to explain the word.

All right.

Fair enough.

Fair enough.

I understand that.

But there are alternatives.

There are simpler dictionaries that can give you the meaning, explain the meaning more simply, one

that I really like is vocabulary.

Dotcom, and they don't pay me vocabulary dot com, so they're not giving me money to say this.

I actually think it's pretty good because the explanations that they give and the examples that they

give of the different words are pretty clear, pretty simple.

And I particularly like the examples that they don't have every word that you will need to know.

So they are a little bit more limited.

But for the majority of words that you would use every day, common words, they have them.

And the examples are quite good.

So I recommend that one.

There are others.

Dictionary dotcom is pretty good.

There are a couple of other dictionaries, a couple of apps you can download on your phone.

These are also good.

Just find a way to learn words in English with an English dictionary.

That's the key.

That's the point.

Now, connected with this is forms.

Some words have only one form, right, but most words, many, many, many words have more than one

form, right.

Learning.

For example, this word has more than one form.

Learning.

Learn.

Learned.

Right.

So we have to learn all of the forms.

When you learn a word, when you see a new word and you want to understand it, don't only try to understand

that one form that you see in the last lesson we talked about the word produce, right.

Look up all of the meanings of produce, how it's used, the examples try to completely understand that

word.

OK, so it's better that you do that one time, then having to look up each of the forms every time

that you see it, it's kind of a waste of time.

Better if you when you learn a word, find all of the forms of the word, study all of the meanings

of all of the forms, and then have a good understanding of it so that you can use it in the future

and so that you can actually understand the other forms when you hear the other forms.

OK, so that's a pretty key point.

Now, one of the things I talked about in the last lesson was context.

And remember, context means the situation that something is in what's around it.

That's the context of that.

And it's really important, I believe, to learn words in context because in life.

We don't just speak single words.

We have to speak words in sentences to explain ideas, right?

We use words, we need to use words whether it's writing or speaking.

Right.

And so if you learn words in natural situations like we did in the last lesson, write in reading,

we learn a word in a sentence and we understand it is in this whole sentence.

Oh, it can be used to talk about red wine, produce red wine.

OK.

When you learn things in context, you can see how it's used and when it is natural to use it and maybe

when it is not natural to use it.

So learning words in context is really, really important.

And now I would like to actually practice learning words in context.

OK, so let's do that.

All right.

So here we have a sentence.

OK, we've come across this sentence in an article online now and I don't know, Wikipedia.

This is not actually on Wikipedia.

OK, so just for example, we've read it online and we see a word that we don't understand.

Hmm.

What to do?

There seem to be a direct correlation, correlation, correlation between the number of babies born

and the health standards in that area.

OK, now maybe we understand health.

OK, we know what health means to be healthy, right?

It's the you know, that's sometimes it's a noun, sometimes an adjective.

OK, let's say we know standards, standards are certain levels that we have in a certain levels that

have certain standards or requirements sometimes.

Maybe it means requirements sometimes, OK, maybe it means this one, I understand that area we know

OK area same as place region.

S..

It's the same as region.

All right, babies, I know babies is a small human.

OK, direct, OK, direct is the opposite of indirect direct means without.

Anything.

Between.

OK, without any other things, without anything between.

All right, all right, I understand that, but correlation, I don't understand correlation.

All right.

So we look up the word correlation.

What do we get when we probably get a few different forms, but we will find correlation is a noun.

OK, so we know it's a noun.

All right, great.

That helps us.

But we also find that it's a verb.

We find that it's verb.

Form is correlate.

OK, it's verb form is correlate, OK?

All right, that helps me a little bit.

There's a noun form is a verb form.

Now we also find when we look it up, has an adjective form, has an adjective form.

Wonderful, great, amazing.

Correlated.

OK, good, good.

Well, that's really messy.

Sorry about that.

Correlated, correlate correlation.

OK, OK.

I know we have these these three main forms.

Great.

And what does it mean.

So I look up the definition.

Definition is the meaning, and what I find is basically correlates or correlated or correlation means

a connection.

Relationship.

And one thing that can help me is to look at synonyms.

These are words that have basically the same meaning.

There's some difference in some cases, but essentially very similar meaning I see it means kind of

a connection, a relationship.

Now, maybe I've already figured that out from the context.

Context, remember, is the situation, there seem to be a direct correlation between the number of

babies born and health standards, babies born and health standards.

There's two things direct.

What between two things?

Well, are there many possible meanings for this word correlation if we really understand the rest of

the sentence?

Not really.

There aren't many possibilities for what correlation could mean.

So we might be able to figure out the word just from the context.

We might be able to guess that correlation means relationship.

So maybe we have a guess.

We look it up.

We find the three main forms correlated, correlate correlation.

All right.

So that helps us to understand it a little better.

Now we look up the definition synonyms.

We find it's similar to a connection relationship.

This helps to confirm what we thought.

Our guess about the word.

OK, so now we're beginning to feel this word, what it means.

Have we looked up the word in another dictionary, our language dictionary?

No, we have not.

We need to know.

We did not know if you are a beginner and you don't know any English at all, probably a good idea to

have a dictionary that's in your language.

But if you understand 80 percent of what I'm saying in this course, if you're taking this course,

you probably do not need to use a dictionary in your own language and English.

OK, so we've looked it up.

We understand it.

Now, let's go back to the sentence and see how it works in the sentence.

There seem to be a direct correlation.

Can we put in the word relationship into the sentence?

There seem to be a direct relationship between the number of babies born and health standards in the

area.

Yes, that works perfectly awesome.

There seem to be a direct connection between the number of babies born and the health standards.

Yeah, pretty well.

That works pretty well.

So we're beginning to get a feeling for this word, how it's used and we might even be comfortable enough

to try to use it in a couple of situations.

And now that we've got a feeling for how it's used, now that we understand this word in context.

So let's try that.

Let's see if we can make a couple of sentences with it now.

All right.

So here we've come up with a couple of sentences that we can use to practice the new word we've learned.

Correlation, correlated, correlate.

OK, let's see.

I wonder if there is a correlation between happiness and income.

We noticed in the sentence that we learned the word from that between followed correlation.

Right.

We had originally a direct correlation between the number of babies born.

Right.

So we'll use this after correlation because that's typically how it's done, at least in our experience.

All right.

We shouldn't do anything out of our experience unless we want to play with the word which we can.

We should always have a way to check that.

I wonder if there is a correlation between happiness and income.

We have two things, A and B, and we want to know if there's a relationship between A and B, so why

not use the word correlation?

And I wonder means I'm thinking about, OK, so this works.

This is a sentence that helps us understand how to use it.

And once you've learned a word, make a sentence.

Let's try another form.

Remember, we learned another form when we looked it up in the dictionary.

The other form is correlated.

OK, so let's see.

Global warming.

Global warming means the earth is getting hotter and the natural disasters like typhoons, hurricanes,

this kind of thing and natural disasters are obviously correlated, obviously means easy to see clear

clearly.

Easy to see.

Easy to see that obviously correlated.

OK, we've used it in another form, but it also makes sense here, right, because we know that Correlated

is having a connection between here's one thing, natural disasters.

Here's to global warming.

These things are related.

These things have a connection.

So why not use the word correlated?

Sure we can.

Now, one thing you can do to check this is ask someone who knows if it's right or wrong, your teacher

right.

Or maybe a forum online you could use, for example, on Cloud English dot net, which is a website.

You can go to one of the pages and ask a question, is this right?

Is this meaning right?

And get an answer.

It's another way you could do it.

So, yes, correlated works in this one as well.

Now we're beginning to build the tree a little bit more, right?

The deep understanding of the language.

Not only do we know what this word means in our language, no, we understand it in English.

We've thought about it in English.

We've learned it in English.

We understand the situation.

It was used in English.

Now we understand basically how to use it in English by thinking.

So this is how to learn words.

This is the process for learning a new word.

Do this every time you come across a new word.

It's a struggle.

It's harder.

But the struggle, the difficulty is what makes it stick in your mind.

OK, so always go into struggle.

Don't run away from struggle.

Struggle is good.

Struggle can help you really, really learn something deeply.

This is how to learn words.

All right.

In the next lesson, we're going to be talking about idioms.

We're going to be talking about expressions, idioms, how to use them, when to use them.

We're not going to be learning many, but we're going to be talking about this and how this relates

to building the English brain.

So I will see you in the next lesson.

### Work excercise
So in the last lesson, we talked about idioms and we talked about that when you learn idioms, you

can't just learn the meaning.

You have to try to get a feeling for it, just like when you're learning words.

Hmm.

What are the different possible meanings?

What feeling does this give when I use it?

In which situations is it better to use and who uses it?

Is it local for one place or another place?

And that these things are very important in being able to use it correctly and knowing when to use it.

And in this lesson, we're going to go on and talk about an exercise, a specific exercise that I've

developed to help you really, really focus.

Your ability to think in English, to give you an actual practice that you can do to begin thinking

in English, seriously, OK, and this one is impossible to do without thinking in English.

So you have to think in English when you do.

This exercise is called the four word exercise, and it's very simple.

And you can do it pretty much any time very quickly, just as a way to practice.

Keep English in your mind and to explore and work with the words that you already know.

Not new words, words you already know.

One of the problems with the ability to speak English well is that a lot of people know many words but

find that when they want to speak, they can't find the words that they're looking for, that the words

that they're looking for are buried deep down and they're unsure how to use them.

Well, one of the things that we can do to improve this is to begin to use the words we know in different

ways creatively, creativity.

Is a very important aspect of being able to use language and speak clearly, express your ideas, creativity

is really, really important.

Creativity just means the ability to come up with something new, something you haven't done before.

Right.

So you have to be creative with the words.

You know, you're not just repeating words that you learned.

No.

You have to think about how can these words work together?

How can I make them fit what I want to say?

So that's what we're going to be doing now.

OK, so let me show you this exercise and I hope you can practice it at least a few times a week, and

this can really help you to think in English.

So let's begin.

OK, so this is what we do.

We first write down four words.

What words should we write down?

Well, we could say generally any words are OK, but I would recommend writing down a few different

types of words, maybe a few nouns.

Adjectives.

Verbs, adverbs.

So just write down four words, I just wrote down four words here, I didn't think about it too much.

I just wrote down the first four words I thought of.

Now, why are we writing down four words?

Well, we're going to try to put these four words into a single sentence.

Yes.

All of these four words need to fit into a single sentence.

But the sentence that we make has to make sense.

It has to be clear.

The grammar has to be good.

Everything has to work.

And so we're going to have to think about these four words and how to fit them together in English.

If we don't think about it in English, how can we do it?

How can we make them fit together for thinking in another language and changing it to English?

We must be thinking in English to do this really well.

So first we need to look at the forms.

A stable has a couple of different forms, stable as an adjective and means something that doesn't move

easily.

Stable can also be a noun.

The noun stable is a place where horses live.

OK, so horse lives in a stable.

Now, I would also allow you in this exercise to use different forms.

Of each word, so if I wanted to change the word stable to stabilize.

OK, do it.

No problem.

Change stable to stabilize.

That's another form stick.

Could be a verb to stick one thing to another.

OK, so also a stick could be something like this that you hold from a tree, for example, sticky with

a Y could be an adjective.

We can change it to that common adjective.

Something that's common.

Right.

Commonly could be an adverb.

Right.

We could use commonly commoner could be a noun right across.

Across can be a preposition.

It's a good one to use.

It could also be an adverb.

We could say go across for example.

So preposition, adverb, these all have different forms and the first thing you can do is just look

at the words and see how many different forms can you come up with for each of the words.

All right.

Now what we need to do is try to think about how we can fit these together.

We can put them in any order that we want.

We don't have to say stable first and then stick and then common.

We could say stable last, common first, stick second to last.

OK, all OK, so this is the challenge.

Now, I want to give you a couple of examples of different sentences that I've made that I've come up

with.

And this can give you an idea about how you might do it.

Now, just because I give you a couple of examples doesn't mean that those are the only examples that

would work.

You need creativity to be able to come up with many different examples.

So let's look at my examples.

All right, so now let's look at an example that I've come up with for these four words, and again,

not the only possibility as a common one rule, I'd say sticking sticking is a form.

Sticking to your plans will make you come across, come across, come across in this situation means

what other people think about you.

Other people will think this about you.

We'll make you come across as a stable person to others.

Stable person basically means someone who doesn't just change their mind, suddenly stable person,

someone who does what they say they will do.

So there's a common rule, I'd say sticking to your plans will make you come across as a stable person

to others.

Now, this is one possibility, but I would like you to do now is stop the video, pause the video,

take these forwards, try to now come up with another sentence.

So stop it right here and come up with another sentence that includes these four words.

See if you can do it.

Don't get stuck thinking that the way that I've used these words is the only way.

It certainly is not.

And when you come back, I'll give you another example to prove that to you.

OK, so how did you do?

Were you able to come up with at least one sentence with these four words?

I hope so.

If it was really challenging for you and you found it impossible to change, the words come up with

four different words and I will give you four more words.

But don't be limited to these words that I give you.

You can choose any words you like.

Maybe you use the name of a city, Paris, yellow, windy.

OK, fine.

Use these words.

OK, now I've got another example here that I'd like to share with you.

I thought I'd or I had I thought I'd come across just a common stick, but it was actually part of a

fence used in prehistoric stables.

I thought I'd come across this.

Meaning I've come across is to find something OK.

I thought I'd come across just a common normal stick.

Stick is a thing that comes off of a tree, right?

A little piece of wood stick.

But it was actually part of a fence used in prehistoric.

That means long, long ago, long, long ago.

Stables stable in this situation means the place where horses live.

So a place where horses lived long, long ago.

OK, so this is another possibility.

So I hope you've come up with something interesting as well.

OK, now I'm going to do one more example.

I'm going to give you four more words and we'll look at a couple of other examples that are possibilities.

But again, don't limit yourself to those ideas.

Come up with your own ideas.

If you find my words a little too difficult, change them, try some more words, try some different

words, play around with it.

This exercise is about play.

Shouldn't be terrible and difficult.

It's playing with words, playing with language.

And playing is really important, especially when you want to learn to think in English to have an English

brain.

OK, so let's go on.

OK, next four words.

Sign ship.

Strange beneath sign ship strange beneath.

OK sign.

Could be a verb to sign something sign could be an indication or something that tells you something.

Ship could be a verb to send something or to send maybe yourself you could ship to somewhere.

Ship could also be a thing.

Right.

A big boat.

Strange, unusual.

Common uncommon.

Strangely we could also say stranger again we can use different forms of the word and beneath is similar

to under.

OK, at the first sign of something strange going on we shipped off or we went, we left to America

and escaped beneath anyone's notice.

So we can say beneath someone's notice or escaped under someone's notice.

Beneath someone's notice.

OK, so this is a possibility.

Now, I want you to try this again.

Take these four words, stop the video, pause the video, come up with your own sentence, see if you

can come up with something that works.

OK, it has to make sense.

Try.

OK, so here are some examples of how we can use these four words in two sentences.

First, beneath under the yellow sign.

This is a physical sign, a thing on the ship cabin door.

The cabin is where you go into the ship was a strange marking, a strange marking.

A marking is sort of a thing maybe in the wood of the ship.

Maybe like a symbol that could be a strange marking, another one, shipping company managers, the

kind of company shipping company shipping company managers have to sign this sign is a verb, as in

sign your name, sign their names on packages, sign their names on packages beneath or below a certain

weight.

So maybe under 70 kilograms, for example, beneath a certain weight, which I think is strange, which

I think is strange.

That means I think this idea of having to do this, having to sign their names is strange.

So we've used all of them again.

So I hope you can come up with a couple of examples.

Don't use only one sentence.

Try to come up with two, three, four sentences to do this.

And this can really, really push your mind to be using English creatively, thinking about how you

can fit these words together, change them, adjust them, play with them.

And this can really help your English brain.

Now, once this is easy for you and you're able to do forwards automatically, naturally, easily,

come up with three or four sentences, then make it five words, six words, seven words, keep going

up, keep pushing yourself.

If it isn't difficult, then you're not doing it right.

It's very, very easy.

Then you're not going to be improving very quickly.

It has to be difficult, difficult struggle.

These are the things that push you to get better.

So always challenge yourself.

Do this exercise as often as you can.

It's a great and simple way to practice and build your English brain.

OK, now in the next lesson, we're going to be talking about another exercise that we can do to improve

and work on our English brains.

And this is variations, variations, also really important, really useful and a great way to work

on creativity.

So I'll see you in the next lesson.

### Variations 
OK, so in the last lesson, we talked about the forward exercise and how this can help us with the

words we already know, this can help us to improve not only our understanding of the words we know,

but also help with the creativity, the ability to think with the words we know.

And, of course, that means the ability to speak more quickly and more naturally.

Why are we building our English brains?

What's the reason?

Well, if we're able to think in English, we're able to speak easily in English.

And it's it's really that simple.

OK, you have to be able to think in English if you want to be able to speak naturally in English.

So in this lesson, we're going to be working on variations.

So what's a variation?

A variation is basically a change.

We have something as it is and we change it and now we have a variation.

Now, we shouldn't change it so much that it's totally different than what we had before.

Usually a variation is very similar to the original and has the same general meaning.

Has the same general form is generally the same, but looks different, so we make a change, but we

try to keep what was there before now when we're doing this with sentences.

That's really what I mean.

We're going to be taking a sentence and then looking at the different ways that we can change it, that

we can say that basic same thing in slightly different ways, different forms.

This is a kind of play, really.

This is a kind of play.

And as I said in the last lesson, I believe that play is a very important part.

Of your language ability, just like it's important to read, reading is a very important part of your

language ability, writing is a very important part of your language.

Ability play is a very important part of your language ability.

What do I mean by play, though?

Play basically just means.

Using things in new ways.

And not necessarily focusing on being totally 1000 percent correct.

But instead, trying to be creative with the things that you already know so that you can find new connections,

right, when a child is learning how to do something, basically that's play and through their play,

they can learn how to communicate, learn how to use things in the world, understand things better.

We can do the same thing with language.

We can do the same thing with English.

So play can really help us a lot.

So let's now go into what we're going to be doing.

Let's go into this and actually do it.

I'm going to write down a simple sentence.

OK, here's the sentence.

I think it might take a few days for me to help you book your tickets.

I think it might take a few days for me to help you book your tickets.

Here's our original sentence that we're going to be using.

OK, now we're going to be making a variation with this.

We're going to be changing this.

We're going to be saying it differently.

We're going to be trying to keep the same basic meaning, but trying to see how many different ways

that we can say the same basic meaning.

So what I want you to do right now is I want you to stop the video, pause the video, and I want you

to try to write this basic thing, but use different words to do it.

You can use some of the same words, make some changes, don't only change the words around.

See if you can come up with a completely different way.

That's also correct.

Basically to say this, to say this simple meaning.

This is pretty simple, right?

Take me a few days to help you book your tickets.

Pretty simple.

I think you can understand it.

So stop the video.

Do that.

I will wait for you.

So have you got a variation?

Does it work?

Is it basically the same if.

Yes.

Congratulations.

Nice job.

Keep doing this.

Keep practicing this.

What you can do is look at a sentence from, say, a book you're reading and just write down the sentence

at the top of a piece of paper and then try to write the same sentence many different ways, basically

the same meaning.

Now let's do that.

Here's my first variation.

I think I can have your tickets booked in a few days.

What's the difference between these two?

I think it might take me a few days to help you book your tickets.

Well, we didn't say help you to have your tickets booked to help you book your tickets.

But we can say that basically this is the same.

Right.

If I am booking your tickets to have your tickets booked, that means I'm helping you.

We didn't say I'm helping you, but it means that basically the same.

OK, now, basically, I think it might take I think I can have well, might is different than can have,

but we're saying we're not sure because we're using I think actually in the first sentence saying it's

might.

I think it might.

That's like saying I'm not sure, I'm not sure two times.

So the second one might be a little bit better.

I think it is a little bit better.

OK, how about yours?

Is yours simpler, more complicated?

Did you just move the words around?

Right now I want to go over a couple more variations of this.

How about this one?

Give me a few days to book your tickets.

Well, this one is more different than the original, but we still have the same basic idea in the first.

And we said I think it might take me.

That's letting the other person know how long it will take you.

This one give me a few days is saying basically it might take me a few days, but instead requesting

that this person wait for you.

So it's the same basically, instead of me telling you it will take me this many days, I think I'm

asking you right or I'm I'm asking you to allow me to have a certain number of days.

OK, so essentially it's the same thing.

And this one is really simple.

This one is incredibly simple.

Now, one difference in the feeling of these two.

Remember, we talked about the word connotation.

Connotations sort of the suggested feeling of something not exactly the meaning, but how it feels in

the situation.

Give me a few days.

Sounds like you do this right.

You have no choice.

Give me a few days and then the other person will have to say, OK, OK.

I think the first one is more polite and the second one, give me a few days is more like a demand or

just saying what will happen rather than focusing on making the other person feel really comfortable.

OK, the next variation of this original sentence I can reserve reserve means book say, meaning I can

reserve your tickets if you like, but it might take me a few days.

What's the difference between this one and the original?

I think it might take me a few days for me to help you book your tickets means I'm going to do it,

but I'm just trying to tell you how long it will take.

This one.

I haven't agreed to do it.

This one.

Maybe I'm just offering to do it.

I'm saying I can do it.

I can reserve.

I'm offering to do it.

I don't mind doing it.

If you want me to do it, I will.

But then I want to say, if I do do it, then it will take me several days, it will take me a few days.

And so this one has a different feeling and actually has a different meaning because it could be that

I'm just offering rather than having already agreed like the first one.

All right.

I've already agreed and I think it might take me a few days.

This one I can do it if you want, is the real meaning here.

Probably doesn't always mean that, but it really could mean that.

All right.

So let's look at one more variation of this one.

And this one is similar to one that we had done before.

But it is a different form because we're using if if you give me a few days, I can book your tickets.

OK, so this one is kind of the opposite of what we had said, not the meaning.

I mean, the form is the opposite if you give me a few days.

So first time asking for the time if means you could or could not if you don't.

I want to do it.

If you do, I will.

If you give me a few days.

If you allow me to have a few days, I can book your tickets.

This one again is not agreeing to do it.

It's offering to do it.

I will if you want me to write, but I need some time.

So if you give me a few days, I can book your tickets.

We could add for you, but we don't need to because we said book your tickets.

If we said book your tickets for you, no problem.

Fine.

Some people would say that's a little bit redundant.

Because it kind of has the same meaning, it isn't necessary, but you could still say it, I could

book your tickets for you, I can book your tickets for you.

So this is another possibility.

All right.

Now, this exercise is so simple, just like the four word exercise we did in the last lesson, all

you do is get a sentence, OK, from the Internet, from a book, anywhere, find a sentence, find

a good one with some interesting stuff in it.

OK.

Now ask yourself, how many times can I write this sentence in different ways and still keep the original

meaning?

Well, here we've done several we've done quite a few different variations of this and we could do more.

I'm not saying these are the only ways to write variations of this sentence.

Right.

It would take me an hour or more to talk about all of the possible reasonable variations of this sentence.

The idea is basically that you have to play experiment with grammar, with the words, you know, and

you should understand the sentence that you choose completely so that you can do it well.

This play allows you to be thinking in English as you come up with the new ways to express the original

main idea, the idea of the original sentence.

And it frees up a new ability, so instead of just repeating all of the phrases that you've learned

before, instead of just repeating the things that you've heard before.

Exactly.

You now have a deeper awareness of language and ability to think in the language and use it creatively.

And that is an incredibly important skill.

So practice this whenever you can't practice this when you have time later in the course, I will give

you a plan that you can use to improve your English brain and you can include this exercise in that

plan.

So I think you should do it regularly, just like the forward exercise that we talked about in the last

lesson.

And it can really, really help you with your English brain and your ability to think in English.

All right.

In the next lesson, we're going to be talking about another kind of variation, variation of whole

paragraphs, long variation, and it's different.

So you'll see.

I'll see you in the next lesson.

### Listening
-: In the last lesson and the short clip,

we focused on listening and the importance of listening.

If you don't have a sharp ear,

how can you understand others?

How can you communicate with others?

But also doing listening practice,

sharpening our ear can force us to think in English,

because we have to think about

what could this person be saying, right?

What might they be saying forces us to think in English?

Very, very useful, okay?

In this lesson,

we're going to be talking about pure thinking in English

and above anything else,

this needs to become a habit.

The other things are exercises

that you sit down and you decide to do

and you spend five or 10 minutes doing regularly to improve.

Great, awesome.

You should and need to do those things

but now I would like to share something with you,

about thinking in English purely

that is not necessarily an exercise

that you sit down and decide to do suddenly,

but something that you need to get

in the habit of doing anytime.

Usually, often, whenever, okay?

Now, habits make or break us, right?

If you have bad eating habits, you become unhealthy.

If you have good eating habits, you become healthy.

If you're in the habit of going out for a run every day,

you're likely to be more healthy.

If you're in the habit of packing a very healthy lunch

to bring to work rather than buying McDonald's or something,

then you're likely to be more healthy.

So, if you have the habit of doing

what I'm going to tell you in this lesson,

you're likely to be better at thinking in English.

You're likely to be better at communicating in English.

You're likely to be more comfortable with English.

Pretty simple, okay?

So, I would like to describe and talk about with you

what you can do.

It's really simple.

You find yourself in a situation with,

I don't know, nothing to think about, nothing to do,

nothing going on, right?

Let's say you're in your office,

sitting down in your chair,

your computer is here looking out the window.

Well, why not start to describe the stuff,

the things that are going on outside of the window.

Why not start trying to describe these things in detail?

Not only describing exactly what you see

but describing how you feel about what you see,

what might happen next,

why this person is here,

what's going on in the background, right?

All of these things, these connections,

these visual images that we see,

all of these things can basically be described.

Now, we could write these things down,

but we can also think these things.

Thinking thoughts in English.

It's not all that different

from writing down your ideas in English.

Yeah, it's a little, little different,

because you can write something down and check it and say,

"Oh, that's not right or that's right or that's good,"

and look at it, right?

So, yeah.

But thinking in English does force English words

to go through your mind.

I mean, when I look over there on the table,

I see a cup and the word cup comes into my mind.

The word cup comes into my mind,

even if I don't say out loud, the word cup, there it is.

The word cup is there.

I can see it in my mind,

and the word brown comes into my mind,

because the cup is brown.

And -- because there's a -- in the cup.

All of these things come into my mind,

whether or not I speak them,

whether or not I actually say the words.

So, one thing that you can do

is just describe your environment in English,

in your mind and if you find it very easy, there's a cup.

If you find it very, very easy.

So, challenge yourself, add more detail, make up stories,

be creative.

And if you get into the habit of doing this

on a regular basis,

you will find that you're always thinking in English.

Constantly having English in your mind

is really, really good.

I always have English in my mind.

I always have,

because of that my English is pretty good, right?

Most native speakers, pretty good English, right?

Why?

English is always in their minds.

English is all around them.

They're surrounded by English.

English, English, English.

Okay, so they speak English naturally.

You maybe speak a language naturally too.

Why?

You think in that language always.

When you're a baby,

you learn that language very early.

You connected things with that language very early, right?

All around you.

You have to do the same thing with English,

you have to do the same thing.

You can't just say,

"I'm going to learn some words from a book,

"A, B, C, D, right?"

This isn't how you learn language.

This isn't how it works.

This isn't how you learn your language.

Why do you expect to get good at another language?

Doing it with a list of words.

Of course not, okay?

I'm not saying a list of words is bad.

Sometimes it's useful,

but having these thoughts in English,

describing things is a key tool for you.

So, let's do this.

Now, I haven't planned this.

I haven't decided what I'm going to say,

It's going to be pure natural, okay?

I'm gonna be speaking this,

because it would be pretty boring for you

if I were just doing this

for the next few minutes, right?

You can guess what I'm saying,

but that would be pretty boring for you and not very useful.

I'm going to be speaking.

I'm gonna be saying what I'm thinking

to show you how you can do this and you can do this.

Okay, so let's start very simply.

Out the window.

All right, looking out the window,

there's a big window here.

I'm not gonna say that in my mind, big window,

there is one, but I'm looking out the window, okay?

One, mountain.

Mountain, all right,

well there are a lot of different mountains.

Is it Mount Everest?

Does it have snow on top?

Is it like a desert?

Is it dry?

Is it brown?

Is it green trees?

What?

A large mountain.

Okay, with two peaks.

One, two.

A large mountain with two peaks, has trees on it.

A large tree covered mountain with two peaks

and some people doing exercise on the peak of the mountain.

I can see them out the window, okay?

So, some people doing exercise on the top of a mountain

with two peaks.

On the top of a forest-covered mountain with two peaks.

Tree covered mountain with two peaks.

All right, fair enough.

Blue sky.

Blue sky with puffy white clouds,

a blue sky with puffy white clouds

and a few pigeons flying around in the sky.

Okay, that's pretty simple.

That's pretty easy, right?

Okay, you've got English going around in your brain.

Alright, let's see what else we can see over there.

Some tall gray buildings.

What kind of buildings?

Some tall gray apartment buildings.

Interesting, okay?

Nine tall gray apartment buildings in an apartment complex.

Complex is a group of buildings that go together.

Nine tall, gray, boring apartment buildings

in a large apartment complex,

surrounded by some green trees.

Better.

Nine tall, depressing looking gray apartment buildings

in an apartment complex surrounded by green trees,

near a tall mountain with two peaks

and there are some people doing exercise

on the top of the mountain.

Alright, there we go.

I could have put that together probably a little better

but I'm thinking in English.

Okay, looking down.

By the way,

I live on the 20th floor so I can see far down here.

A little girl.

Nope, that's a boy.

(tutor laughing)

A boy with long hair.

A little boy with long hair wearing a striped polo shirt,

riding wildly on his bicycle.

It looks like he just learned how to ride the bicycle,

because he can't steer it very well

and he looks very uncomfortable on the bicycle.

But because he's pedaling so fast,

it seems like he's really, really excited

to be able to finally ride a bicycle by himself, right?

And so he doesn't care that maybe he's not very good yet.

He just wants to ride as fast as he can.

And the little boy is riding along the sidewalk

and his mother is trying to run after him to catch him,

because maybe she's afraid

that he's going to hurt himself, okay?

The mother is wearing a purple blouse

and a long skirt with flowers and sandals.

She has brown hair, okay?

Beside them,

there is an old man with a white T-shirt,

very dark skin, okay?

Light gray hair, smoking a cigarette

and it looks like he's talking to himself.

He might be talking to himself,

because he's deciding what he's going to do tomorrow

or maybe something difficult happened today.

And he's talking about what he can do to solve the problem.

Why is he talking about it out loud to himself?

Well, I don't know, maybe he feels lonely.

Maybe he has nobody to talk to.

Maybe he doesn't care what other people think.

Okay, now I've said a lot of things.

I'm just sort of going on and on and on about things

that I see.

I'm not really thinking carefully.

I'm not planning anything.

I'm not too worried about making everything perfect.

I could make the description of the mountain

and the apartment complex better if I worked harder.

But the point is,

I've just got thoughts going on in my mind, right?

I've got things happening in my head in English

and this is what you can do every day, all the time.

Make it a habit.

Get used to it.

You might think it's weird at first, right?

This is weird.

I don't wanna think in English.

That's very strange.

English is something that you study.

English is something that you learn when you read,

not only, not only, okay?

Start thinking in English.

Do it or don't do it,

better if you do it.

If you do, you'll see results.

It's that simple, alright?

So, next time you're by yourself you've got nothing to do,

you're bored.

Just try this,

look around you.

What do you see?

Describe it.

Go deeper and deeper.

Give more and more detail.

Wonder about things.

Ask questions to yourself about,

"Well, why is he talking to himself?"

Ask questions to yourself.

Guess, make assumptions.

Assumptions is where you guess something

but you don't know if you're right or wrong.

Who cares?

It's in your mind.

Nobody knows if it's right or wrong, right?

Alright, so practice this, do it.

And in the next lesson we're going to go on

and we're going to talk about writing.

How we can use writing

as a way to work on our English brain,

on our thinking in English.

So, I'll see you in the next lesson.
