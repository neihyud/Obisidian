# How to approach a system design interview question

 - Step1: Gather requirements and scope the problem. Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints. Discuss assumptions.
	- Who is going to use it?
	- How are they going to use it?
	- How many users are there?
	- What does the system do?
	- What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
	- How much data do we expect to handle?
	- How many requests per second do we expect?
	- What is the expected read to write ratio?
